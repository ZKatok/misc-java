PURPOSE OF PROJECT: This project takes a word, counts how many letters it has,
turns that number into a word (e.g. 3 becomes "three"), counts how many letters it has,
etc, until it reaches four. Traditionally, the initial word is also a number; it is conjectured that
no matter what number you pick, the chain will end at four (because four has 4 letters). In English, that is...

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Start it up in BluJ. Type in a word when prompted and hit enter.
The word cannot be longer than 99 letters.
